## Session tools ({{DSL}})

Use the following exact CLI subcommand names; there are no function-style aliases. For each call,
write one JSON request under `scratch/`, then run exactly one of:

```text
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} gateway-execute --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} kernel-trial-show --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} kernel-artifact-read --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} gateway-result-read --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} update-direction --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} list-directions --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} load-direction --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} record-experiment --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} list-experiments --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} load-experiment --request scratch/<request>.json
python3 {{RUNTIME_TOOL}} attempt-report --request scratch/<request>.json
```

`gateway-execute` automatically attaches the exact current `work/kernel` tree and trusted Runtime
fields. Never embed a candidate, schema version, capability, or attempt ID in its request.
Runtime-local history queries use their dedicated commands above;
do not pass `kernel_trial_show`, `kernel_artifact_read`, or
`gateway_result_read` to `gateway-execute`.

Every `gateway-execute` request names one `operation`. These are the only Agent-authored fields;
each is optional with the default shown in parentheses unless marked required, and an omitted field
is normally the right choice:

```text
evaluate     no further fields; Runtime measures all contract Shapes in batches and merges results
profile      level=survey|sol|deep (sol), profiler=ncu|rocprofv3, counters=[], source (false),
             kernel_name or kernel_regex, launch_skip, launch_count, top_kernels, shape_id
dev          command (required), file_paths=[], env_vars={}, job_timeout_s (<=600), recycle (true),
             note, intent=workspace|scratch_exec|inspect|compile|profile_adhoc|sanitize|
             custom_harness|other
check        arch, sanitize=memcheck|racecheck|initcheck|synccheck
disassemble  fmt=sass|ptx|isa|auto (auto)
poll         job_id (required), wait (false), include_spec (false)
jobs         kind=eval|profile|dev|compile|sol|disassemble,
             status=queued|running|succeeded|failed|cancelled, limit (50, at most 200)
cancel       job_id (required)
env          gpu, capabilities (false, requires gpu), force (false)
health       no further fields
config       no further fields
```

`profile`, `check`, and `disassemble` additionally accept `env_vars`, `requirements`, and
`deps_mode=freeze_installed|no_deps` to install dependencies for that Job. `kernel_name` and
`kernel_regex` are mutually exclusive, and `level: "deep"` requires one of them. `dev` takes its
extra sources through `file_paths`, a list of workspace-relative paths; each named file is uploaded
under its basename alone and may not shadow a `work/kernel` path, which is why a multi-line probe
does not need to be smuggled through `command`. Prefer `file_paths` over a heredoc inside `command`.

A Gateway call blocks until its Job reaches a terminal state, which for `evaluate`, `profile`,
`check`, and `disassemble` routinely exceeds any local command timeout. Start those calls as a
background task and collect the output once it finishes; a foreground call that is killed locally
leaves the Job running. Keep stderr out of the JSON on stdout, because appending `2>&1` corrupts the
result you then have to parse. Never wrap a call in a `sleep` retry loop: `{"operation": "jobs"}`
lists this Attempt's Jobs, and `{"operation": "poll", "job_id": "<id>", "wait": true}` blocks on one
Job until it is terminal, which replaces the whole loop with a single call. Re-issuing a request
whose Job is still in flight is refused as a binding conflict; re-issuing one that already completed
replays its recorded Result without spending GPU time or call budget, so the way to recover a call
killed by a local timeout is to run the identical request again.

An expected tool failure prints one JSON Object and exits nonzero. For request mistakes, repair the
compact `issues` first, then use the operation-specific `request_schema`; an unknown operation
returns `supported_operations`. Runtime Journal and local Report errors may also return bounded `recovery`
steps naming a visibility-safe list/load tool; execute those steps instead of guessing an ID. A
`candidate_rejected` result created before Job execution includes safe source-validation `details`
that should be fixed directly. A hidden-case failure deliberately omits exact inputs; repair it only
from the public contract, opaque per-Shape results, and safe profiling evidence.

Evaluation results identify private cases only by numeric `shape_id`, such as `"0"` or `"1"`, and
never reveal their inputs. After an evaluation, a profile request may add
`"shape_id":"<numeric id>"` to profile that one real case; omitting it selects one evaluator-owned
case and the Profile result reports the selected number. Do not infer or reconstruct case inputs
from ids or measurements.

A case passes when every output is within `atol=0.01` and `rtol=0.05` of the reference, so compare
the reported `max_abs_err` and `max_rel_err` against those thresholds to see how much margin a
candidate actually has. Every Shape is checked on each evaluation, but each one draws fresh random
inputs, and the authoritative gate that seals a Kernel draws more of them per Shape than an
exploratory evaluate. A single passing evaluation near either threshold is therefore weak evidence:
treat a thin margin as a defect to fix rather than a pass, because the sealing gate rejects a
candidate the Agent measured as correct and that rejection lands after the Session has exited.

Agent-visible Gateway responses follow three contracts:

- `evaluate`, `profile`, `check`, and `disassemble` retain the exact `kernel_artifact_digest`,
  `kernel_trial_id`, and `gateway_result_digest` needed for experiment provenance;
- `dev` returns its Agent-safe Job result directly and does not print those identities;
- `jobs`, `poll`, `cancel`, `env`, `health`, and `config` return their Agent-safe `result` directly.

`check` and `disassemble` report only `status`, `job_id`, `error`, and the nested `result` holding
the compile verdict; a compile-only Job never launches the Kernel, so it carries no register, spill,
or assembly evidence. Use `evaluate` or `profile` for those.

Profile additionally reports the numeric `shape_id`, normalized per-Kernel durations, resource and
SOL evidence, safe profiler counters, and duration-weighted summary fields. No Gateway result echoes
a protocol version or a trusted request identity; the `request_schema` returned with a request error
is the one exception, because it is a schema document and carries its own versions.

Example exploratory evaluation request:

```json
{"operation": "evaluate"}
```

Runtime-local query commands infer their operation from the command name. Their request JSON must
not contain `operation`. Examples are `{"kernel_trial_id":"gtrial_<id>"}` for
`kernel-trial-show`,
`{"kernel_artifact_digest":"sha256:<digest>","artifact_file":"kernel.py",`
`"file":"scratch/recovered/kernel.py"}` for
`kernel-artifact-read`, `{"gateway_result_digest":"sha256:<digest>"}` for
`gateway-result-read`. These reads are unmetered and never contact Agate.
`kernel-trial-show` returns only the Kernel Artifact Digest and a `gateway_results` array; each
entry is `{"operation", "status", "result"}` and omits its already-resolved Gateway Result Digest.
An entry replays whatever that call's Agent-visible response was, so a `dev` entry still carries
the whole Agate Job envelope.
`gateway-result-read` returns `{"operation", "status", "result"}`; the measurement lives under
`result`, not beside those keys. For an Evaluate it holds `correct`, `correctness`, `failures`,
`latency_us_by_shape` keyed by opaque Shape ID, and the aggregates `latency_us_arith_mean` and
`latency_us_geomean`. Those two names differ from the single `latency_us` an Evaluate response
returns, so compare the same field when reading a Result back. It does not reveal private
evaluator inputs or hidden-case details.
For `kernel-artifact-read`, `file` is a required destination under `scratch/`; `artifact_file`
selects the source inside the Artifact and defaults to the destination basename. Source content is
written atomically and is not printed to stdout.

`record-experiment` sends each validated Experiment to Runtime immediately. Runtime durably appends
it to the logical Attempt before the command returns; the Journal therefore survives a crashed
Session and a new recovery generation. Invoke `list-experiments` with
`{"file":"scratch/experiments-index.json"}`; it asks Runtime for the authorized live-plus-history
view, then atomically writes compact
Experiment ID, sequence, name, and action entries to that file and returns only status, file, and
count. Read the file, then invoke `load-experiment` with
`{"experiment_id":"experiment_<id>"}` only for selected entries to retrieve their complete
original records. Both commands are Runtime-local, unmetered, and bounded by Runtime-authorized Lineage
history. Bootstrap starts with no earlier journal history; its current live Journal remains visible.

`update-direction` likewise persists each proposal or lifecycle event in Runtime before returning.
Direction Journal reads are Runtime-local and unmetered. Invoke `list-directions` with
`{"file":"scratch/directions-index.json"}`; it atomically writes Direction ID, name, and current
status to that file and returns only status, file, and count. Read the file, then invoke
`load-direction` with `{"direction_id":"direction_<id>"}` only for selected entries to retrieve
their complete normalized Directions.
Its `supporting_experiment_ids` automatically includes every visible Experiment whose
`direction_id` names that Direction, together with associations snapshotted internally by prior
Direction status events.

A Direction is the durable unit of research and exploration for one causal hypothesis, not an
Experiment container. Before choosing one, inspect only the contract, incumbent, Journal indexes,
and generic Runtime state. Once chosen, immediately `propose` and `start` it before its research,
Dev/Check/Profile/Evaluate, disassembly, tools, or source edits. `TaskCreate`, scratch
plans, and prose do not register it; do not wait for measurement or `record-experiment`.

Propose a Direction with:

```json
{
  "action": "propose",
  "name": "short search direction",
  "hypothesis": "falsifiable mechanism",
  "rationale": "why available evidence makes it worthwhile",
  "plan": ["ordered investigation step"],
  "success_criteria": "measurable condition for success",
  "stop_conditions": "evidence that ends this direction"
}
```

Then call `update-direction` with the returned `direction_id`, an action of `start`, `complete`,
`abandon`, `block`, or `defer`, and non-empty `analysis`. Runtime derives Experiment links; do not
provide them. Events append to history. An Attempt may advance at most three inherited or new
Directions; proposals are unlimited and do not consume this limit. Only one Direction may be
`in_progress` at a time: do not interleave their research, tools, edits, or measurements. Before
starting another, close the current one with `complete`, `abandon`, `defer`, or `block`. None may
remain `in_progress` at handoff. Without an Experiment use `defer` or `block`; `complete` and
`abandon` require supporting Experiments.

Each `record-experiment` request must contain exactly these fields:

```json
{
  "direction_id": "direction_<id>",
  "name": "short experiment name",
  "hypothesis": "falsifiable expected mechanism",
  "change": "exact candidate change, including a reverted change",
  "before": {
    "kernel_artifact_digest": "sha256:<before-kernel>",
    "kernel_trial_id": "gtrial_<before-trial>",
    "gateway_result_digests": ["sha256:<before-evaluate>", "sha256:<before-profile>"]
  },
  "after": {
    "kernel_artifact_digest": "sha256:<after-kernel>",
    "kernel_trial_id": "gtrial_<after-trial>",
    "gateway_result_digests": ["sha256:<after-evaluate>", "sha256:<after-profile>"]
  },
  "evidence": "concise before/after measurements and observations",
  "analysis": "what the evidence means, including whether the hypothesis held",
  "action": "keep_after"
}
```

`before` and `after` bind both sides of the modification to exact source and measurements. Each side
contains one Kernel Artifact Digest, its Trial ID, and a non-empty unique list of every relevant
Evaluate/Profile/Check/Disassemble Result Digest for that exact Kernel. Record the entry before
changing or reverting the candidate. For `keep_after` and `restore_before`, both sides are required.
For `abandon_direction` before any identity-bearing operation, set both `before` and `after` to
`null`; never set only one side to `null`. The phase Prompt may additionally permit Bootstrap-only
`baseline`, which requires `before=null` and a complete `after`. A `dev` result alone supplies no
identity.
`record-experiment` persists the complete entry and prints only a compact receipt such as
`{"status":"recorded","experiment_id":"experiment_<id>"}`; use that ID when referring to the
experiment later. It does not echo the Agent-authored text, assigned sequence, or timestamp.
Keep `evidence` factual: report observations and measurements. Use `analysis` for interpretation,
the hypothesis verdict, causal explanation, limitations, and remaining uncertainty. Do not use a
top-level `result` field; that term is reserved for Gateway responses. `action` records what you
actually did after analysis and normally must be `keep_after`, `restore_before`, or
`abandon_direction`; use `baseline` only when the phase Prompt explicitly permits it.
After each receipt, update the working terminal Report draft
`scratch/attempt-report-draft.json`. Accumulate the Experiment ID in the relevant Finding and
refine the diagnosis, evidence summaries, Profile bindings, knowledge use, and Attempt-level
analysis while the evidence is fresh. The draft may be overwritten throughout the session. Do not
call `attempt-report` during this process. When the engineering loop and all started Directions are
closed, validate the completed draft and use it as the request. The first successful call publishes
the write-once terminal handoff to the separate `scratch/attempt-report.json` and prints only a
compact receipt such as
`{"status":"published","report_status":"candidate_ready","file":"scratch/attempt-report.json",`
`"experiment_count":3,"finding_count":2}`; the report text itself is never echoed back. An
error response publishes nothing: correct the same draft using
`issues`, `request_schema`, and `recovery`, then call `attempt-report` again. Never call it again
after a successful response.

Each `attempt-report` request must contain
exactly these fields:

```json
{
  "status": "candidate_ready",
  "hypothesis": "tested hypothesis",
  "diagnosis": {
    "bottleneck": "localized correctness or performance issue",
    "evidence": "measured evidence supporting the diagnosis"
  },
  "approach": {
    "summary": "engineering mechanism tested",
    "steps": ["ordered step"],
    "expected_impact": "falsifiable expected effect",
    "risks": ["known risk or rollback concern"]
  },
  "final_candidate": {"change_summary": "exact nominated working-tree state, including unchanged"},
  "evidence_summary": {
    "correctness": "Agent-visible correctness evidence",
    "performance": "Agent-visible performance evidence"
  },
  "profile_evidence": {
    "tool_used": "gateway-execute/profile",
    "profiler": "ncu",
    "profile_level": "sol",
    "bottleneck_type": "memory_bound",
    "evidence_summary": "key profiler metrics and host-side observations",
    "evidence_chain": "causal chain from measurements to bottleneck and decision",
    "supporting_results": [{
      "operation": "profile",
      "kernel_artifact_digest": "sha256:...",
      "kernel_trial_id": "gtrial_...",
      "gateway_result_digest": "sha256:..."
    }]
  },
  "analysis": "Attempt-level synthesis and hypothesis verdict",
  "knowledge_used": [{
    "record_id": "stable GPU Wiki Record ID",
    "finding": "relevant knowledge",
    "application": "how it changed the work"
  }],
  "findings": [{
    "category": "correctness or performance",
    "observation": "measured fact",
    "root_cause": "supported cause",
    "resolution": "fix, rollback, workaround, no fix, or deferred action",
    "lesson": "reusable lesson",
    "supporting_experiment_ids": ["experiment_<id>"]
  }],
  "contributing_kernel_trial_ids": ["gtrial_<id>"],
  "blocker": null
}
```

Use `candidate_ready` when nominating the current Kernel for the controller-owned disposition,
`pivot` when the phase Prompt permits ending without a nomination, and `blocked` for an external or
infrastructure blocker. `candidate_ready` does not mean the Kernel is retained or registered; only
Runtime policy can make that decision. `candidate_ready` requires `final_candidate` and a null `blocker`; `pivot`
requires both to be null; `blocked` requires a non-empty `blocker` and null `final_candidate`.
Keep `knowledge_used` and `findings` structured as shown. Directions left `proposed` or `deferred`
are the next available directions and require no duplicate ID list in the report. Every finding
must state its `resolution`: the applied fix, rollback,
workaround, explicit absence of a fix, or deferred action. Every finding must also name one or more
unique `supporting_experiment_ids`
returned by `record-experiment`; each ID must belong to this Attempt's Experiment Journal.
`profile_evidence` must describe evidence returned by Runtime-bound profiling and
bind every supporting Profile result to the exact Kernel Artifact, Kernel Trial, and Gateway
Result identifiers returned by Runtime. Those exact identifiers must also occur in a `before` or
`after` subject of some Experiment in the visible history, so a Profile recorded by an earlier
Attempt stays citable. Include at least one `profile` result, set `profile_evidence`
to `null` if no Profile was executed, and never invent profiler evidence.
Use `contributing_kernel_trial_ids` to name the historical Kernel Trials whose code or approach this
Attempt actually drew on, sorted and unique, using the Trial identifiers Runtime returned. Use `[]`
when you drew on none. It records where your work came from for whoever reads this Attempt later; it
is a claim rather than a measured fact, and it neither replaces nor duplicates the Experiment
`before` and `after` bindings. Do not include the
Journal in the terminal request; the CLI obtains the authoritative current-Attempt snapshot from
Runtime and attaches it. Do not run GPU, compiler, JIT,
profiler, or evaluator work outside these bindings.
